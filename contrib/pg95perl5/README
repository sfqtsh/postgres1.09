DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 1.3 of pg95perl5.

Pg95perl5 is an interface between Larry Wall's language perl version 5 and the
database Postgres95. This has been done by using the Perl5 application program-
ming interface for C extensions which calls the Postgres programmer's interface
LIBQ. pg95perl5 trys to implement the LIBPQ-interface as close, as possible.

Please send comments and bug reports to <E.Mergl@bawue.de>


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - perl5.003
  - Postgres95-1.08


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of pg95perl5 has been developed using Linux 2.0 with 
  dynamic loading for the perl extensions. It also works using static
  loading. Let me know, if there are any problems with other platforms.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Using dynamic loading for perl extensions, the preferred method is to unpack
the tar file outside the perl source tree. This assumes, that you already
have installed perl5.

Make sure, that the locations of the postgres include-files and the libpq-
library in Makefile.PL are correct. Then
 
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install


If you choose static loading, the contents of this package is assumed to be
in the subdirectory ext/Pg in the perl source tree. Build perl5 as described
in the README of perl:
 - when running Configure, add Pg to the list of static extensions.
 - run make depend, make, make install.


TESTING:
--------

Run 'make test'.
Note, that the user running this script must have been created with
the access rights to create databases *AND* users ! Do not run this
script as root !
